# whatSymbol

The notebook explores the development of a system designed to recognize handwritten letters and digits in images, each containing a single symbol. It leverages the widely-used EMNIST dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist), focusing specifically on the following files:
- emnist-balanced-mapping.txt
- emnist-balanced-train.csv
- emnist-balanced-test.csv

This project examines several Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for recognition, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Ultimately, the system is deployed using Gradio, with MLP selected as the prediction model due to its effectiveness.
